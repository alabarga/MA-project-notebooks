We will use the `startswith()` method again, so that options like *thank*full, *greatful*ness, and other derived terms are also considered in the search. "

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Markers can be a particularly good idea to quickly analyse the contents of texts. In this case the topics of our interest and the terms used to identify them were very clear. It would be necessary to work with other topics to see if the method is equally effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequency distribution plots have the disadvantage of not keeping the chronological order of the files (speeches). Conditional frequency distribution plots did not show the same problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also learned that it is important to check if the names of functions and concepts used in NLP programs mean exactly the same as the terms used by academics and theoreticians in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparative perspective assumed for this work determined the need to find possible common parameters for comparison. A non-comparative analysis could be more propitious for a design that goes more in depth and can be better adapted to the particular characteristics of a speech/text."
